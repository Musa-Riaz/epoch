# Cross-Column Drag and Drop Implementation

## What Changed

### The Problem
You had **three separate `DndContext`** components (one per column), which prevented tasks from being dragged between columns. All columns were also sharing the same `tasks` array, making it impossible to differentiate between columns.

### The Solution

#### 1. **Single DndContext**
- Removed the three separate `DndContext` components
- Created ONE `DndContext` wrapping all three columns
- This allows drag events to work across all columns

#### 2. **Task Status Property**
Added a `status` property to each task:
```typescript
type Task = {
    id: string;  // Changed from number to string (dnd-kit requirement)
    priority: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    status: 'todo' | 'inProgress' | 'done';  // NEW!
}
```

#### 3. **Filtered Task Arrays**
Created separate arrays for each column:
```typescript
const todoTasks = tasks.filter(task => task.status === 'todo');
const inProgressTasks = tasks.filter(task => task.status === 'inProgress');
const doneTasks = tasks.filter(task => task.status === 'done');
```

#### 4. **Three Event Handlers**

##### `handleDragStart`
- Captures which task is being dragged
- Stores it in `activeTask` state for the DragOverlay

##### `handleDragOver` 
- Fires continuously while dragging
- Detects when a task enters a new column
- Updates the task's `status` property
- Handles reordering within the new column

##### `handleDragEnd`
- Fires when the drag is complete
- Handles final reordering within the same column
- Clears the `activeTask` state

#### 5. **DragOverlay**
Shows a copy of the task being dragged (gives better visual feedback):
```tsx
<DragOverlay>
  {activeTask ? (
    <TaskCard {...activeTask} />
  ) : null}
</DragOverlay>
```

#### 6. **Pointer Sensor**
Added activation constraint to prevent accidental drags:
```typescript
const sensors = useSensors(
  useSensor(PointerSensor, {
    activationConstraint: {
      distance: 8, // Must move 8px to start drag
    },
  })
);
```

## How It Works

### Cross-Column Drag Flow:
1. **Start dragging** → `handleDragStart` captures the task
2. **Drag over new column** → `handleDragOver` changes task status
3. **Drop** → `handleDragEnd` finalizes position
4. Task automatically appears in the new column (filtered by status)

### Same-Column Reorder Flow:
1. **Start dragging** → `handleDragStart` captures the task
2. **Drag over another task** → `handleDragOver` reorders
3. **Drop** → `handleDragEnd` finalizes position

## Key Features

✅ **Cross-column drag and drop** - Move tasks between columns  
✅ **Within-column reordering** - Reorder tasks in the same column  
✅ **Visual feedback** - DragOverlay shows what's being dragged  
✅ **Smooth animations** - CSS transforms for smooth movement  
✅ **Activation constraint** - Prevents accidental drags  
✅ **Dynamic counters** - Badge shows count per column  
✅ **Opacity feedback** - Dragged item becomes semi-transparent  

## Component Changes

### `member-dashboard/page.tsx`
- Changed task ID type from `number` to `string`
- Added `status` property to tasks
- Replaced multiple `DndContext` with single one
- Added three event handlers
- Added filtered task arrays
- Added sensors configuration
- Added DragOverlay

### `TaskCard.tsx`
- Changed `id` prop type from `number` to `string`
- Changed `isOver` to `isDragging` for better visual feedback
- Added `opacity` to style based on drag state
- Added `active:cursor-grabbing` class

## Usage

Simply drag any task card and drop it on another column or task. The task will automatically move to the new column and update its status!

## Future Enhancements

You can extend this by:
- Persisting changes to a backend API
- Adding animations for column transitions
- Adding a "create task" button that works
- Adding task editing functionality
- Adding task deletion
- Adding column customization
